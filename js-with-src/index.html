  <head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is a JavaScript file with a source map.</h1>

    <!-- where to use <script src="script.js"></script> 
      I) Before </body> (most common)
        Why?
          1. Page loads first
          2. Browser does NOT block the content
          3. Your JavaScript can access all HTML elements (because they already loaded)
        This is the safest and cleanest method.
      II) In the <head> with defer
        note: defer loads the script in parallel and executes it only after the DOM is fully ready.
        Why?
          1. Script downloads in background
          2. Runs ONLY after the full HTML is ready
          3. Keeps <body> clean
          4. This is a modern, recommended pattern
     -->
  </body>
