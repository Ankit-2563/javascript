    <!-- Inside <head> 
          Common for loading libraries, metadata scripts, or anything that doesn't need the DOM. -->

    <!-- Inside <body>
          This is the most common and recommended location for scripts that interact with HTML elements. -->

    <!-- Directly inside <html> but outside <head> and <body>       Technically valid in HTML5. But not recommended because it becomes messy and can cause unpredictable behavior in older browsers or linters. -->
